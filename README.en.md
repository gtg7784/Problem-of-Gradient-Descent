# Problem of Gradient Descent


## What is Gradient Descent?

Gradient Descent is one of ways to solve Optimization problem to find parameters that optimize the function value of Objective function.

It is a method to find optimal parameters by moving with a step size defined in the opposite direction of the gradient of the cost function to find the minimum value location of the objective function.
